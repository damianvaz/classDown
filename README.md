# Motivation

With the 2020 global pandemic we now have to take our classes online, which is ok, depending on how is your setup at home.
But the coolest part about it, is that if the professor wants it, he can record the class and people that couldn't attend, can watch it.

But imagine this scenario: Student A misses class, and so goes to the Professor's website to watch it. 
There he manages to watch the class in a browser, however he can't download it, and even worse he has to watch it at 1x speed
as the professor PAINFULLY and slowly reads from a slide, that he may or may not, have wrote it.

So what's student A to do? Suffer through the endless class at normal speed? Nope! 
the class is already recorded, so there's no reason for that other than *professor doesn't feel like uploading standard video files* 

So student A, creates a tool that downloads all the files, and converts it into a standard .mp4 file, that he can watch it
in a video player with control speed (VLC player is super cool!), so he manages to watch it all up to 4x faster!

This is that tool. With it you only need to know the passwords to his websites, and you can save your precious time!
You're welcome! if you find it useful, you now owe me a coffee ;)
